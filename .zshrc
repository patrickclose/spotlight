I've installed zsh with homebrew and changed my shell to it. I'm having a problem when trying to run the gulp command, which worked before I changed the shell to zsh.

zsh: command not found: gulp
A bit of research leaves me to believe it has something to do with my PATH. My PATH looks like this is my .zshrc file.

# export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
